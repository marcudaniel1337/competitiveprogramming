Nimber Arithmetic for Sprague-Grundy Game Theory

This module implements nimber (nim-number) arithmetic operations that are fundamental
to analyzing impartial games using the Sprague-Grundy theorem. 

In game theory, every impartial game position can be assigned a "nimber" or "Grundy number"
that completely characterizes the winning/losing nature of that position. The beauty is
that we can combine multiple games using nimber arithmetic to analyze complex game states.

Key concepts:
- Nimber addition is XOR (exclusive or)
- Nimber multiplication follows specific rules different from regular arithmetic  
- A position with nimber 0 is a losing position (P-position)
- A position with nimber > 0 is a winning position (N-position)
